E-COMMERCE APPLICATION 

To create an E-Commerce application where users (buyers and sellers) can log in, browse products and manage carts in an intuitive, user-friendly interface.

Buyers can view, sort and purchase products while sellers can list and manage products on sale. The Application utilises Java Swing for its GUI, enabling users (buyer) to view a product catalogue, sort it based on parameters such as price and ratings, manage their shopping cart by adding and removing products and access other e-commerce functions.

Inputs -

1. Login
 - Buyer Login : Requires buyer credentials (username and password) to authenticate and allow access to the platform.
 - Seller Login : Requires seller credentials to verify and enable seller-specific functions like product management (add, remove and update products from product catalogue).


2. Product DataAttributes : Each product has attributes such as price, rating, name and quantity, which the application accepts and displays.
3. Operations : Sorting preferences (price or rating), filtering options, and adding/removing items to/from the cart are inputs from the user.
4. Cart Data
 - Products: Buyers add items to the cart, by clicking on the product.

Output - 

1. Product Display:
The application displays all products in a scrollable list with sorting options.
 - Sorted and Filtered Product Lists:
Based on user-selected sorting criteria (price or rating)
 - Cart View and Confirmation:
The cart displays selected items and total cost before checkout.
Confirmation of order submission or notification if cart items exceed available stock.
- Error and Status Messages:
Login success or failure notifications.
Messages for adding or removing products from the cart, and stock availability alerts.


## Demo

To run the program, it must be executed from MainPage.java.
Upon running the program, the user interface (implemented with swing) will immediately be shown and you can create an account, log in and explore the various features and functionalities provided for the buyer and seller within the application. 

To view the implementation of files and how the data is being stored in them, you can view buyerCred.txt and sellerCred.txt for buyer and seller account details respectively.

Furthermore you can also view the product catalogue in productfile.java.

To update or remove products from the product catalogue as a seller, you must input corresponding information (Product ID) onto the text field before clicking onto the afforementioned options.
